# ezStan
An R package containing helper functions for Stan.

This package contains code I develop through my teaching and personal use of Stan/RStan to make some common tasks easier. It's very much a work in progress and probably won't ever be on CRAN.

## TO DO:
- collectBigStan: collect contents of stderr files
- watchBigStan: compute effective sample size and rhat for each parameter
- watchBigStan: other diagnostics?
- choose either camelCase or snake_case and be consistent
