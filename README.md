# ezStan
An R package containing helper functions for Stan.

This package contains code I develop through my teaching and personal use of Stan/RStan to make some common tasks easier. It's very much a work in progress and probably won't ever be on CRAN.

## TO DO:
- collect_stan: collect contents of stdout & stderr files
- collect_stan: be robust against bad chains
- watch_stan: compute effective sample size and rhat for each parameter
- watch_stan: other diagnostics?
- function to compile stan models without locking up interface
